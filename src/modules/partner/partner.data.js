/**
 * How We Partner — the engagement model.
 *
 * The old page was four capability tabs, which is what the products now cover.
 * This answers what a prospect actually wants before signing: what happens
 * first, how long it takes, what they have to provide, and what comes back.
 *
 * Timings are deliberately expressed as ranges and tied to the dependency that
 * drives them. Nothing here promises an enrollment number.
