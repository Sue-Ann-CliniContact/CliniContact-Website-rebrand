 * Headline stats — proof from our own case studies, not industry claims.
 *
 * The homepage stat band now carries the industry problem (recruitment delays,
 * terminations, sites that enroll nobody); this page carries our proof, so the
 * two never repeat. Every number below is drawn from the case studies rendered
 * on this same page: 11 studies in the library across 7 therapeutic areas; UT
 * Austin tripled the monthly flow of pre-qualified participants; McLean ran 421
 * participants through a single screener.
 *
 * NOTE: keep the "11" in step with the length of DOCS below, and confirm the
 * per-study figures before publication. Do NOT reinstate the old "NPS 91" claim,
 * testimonials.data.js records that it was an artifact of a curated subset.
