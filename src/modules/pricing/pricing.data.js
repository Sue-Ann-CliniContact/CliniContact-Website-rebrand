/**
 * Pricing.
 *
 * Packaging (from Sue-Ann): Smart Screener and Vision are never sold
 * separately — they come included with Horizon or Bridge. Horizon and Bridge
 * can be combined. Anchors are "from" prices; everything above the entry tier
 * is scoped to a quote.
 *
 * Confirmed prices:
 *   Horizon — from $800/mo, one study at one site. Ad spend is the client's own
 *             budget, set separately. NO management or optimization fee.
 *   Bridge  — from $1,200 per indication, across multiple sites.
 *
 * The demo/pricing form is the CTA target for every tier.
