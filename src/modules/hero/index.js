/**
 * Homepage hero.
 *
 * Three constraints shape the copy:
 *
 * 1. No enrollment promise. CliniContact delivers prescreened, verified
 *    referrals; the site consents and enrolls. Headlining "enrolled" commits to
 *    an outcome outside their control, which is both a commercial risk and
 *    something sponsors will push on. The endpoint is the site handoff.
 * 2. No competitor reference. Naming a rival on your own homepage reads
 *    defensively and gives them oxygen. The differentiator — that we take no cut
 *    of ad spend, so our incentives are not to inflate it — is stated as a
 *    category fact about how most vendors are paid, never as a named comparison.
 * 3. No volume metrics; scale is the comparison CliniContact loses. Lead with
 *    aligned incentives, transparency and the whole-study relationship instead.

/**
 * `accent` is a bright variant of each product's signature colour (the product
 * sections use darker, text-safe versions of the same hues on white). Bright is
 * needed here because the badges sit on the dark navy hero.

            Most recruitment vendors earn more when you spend more. We built CliniContact the other way. We
            take no cut of your ad spend, we pace the budget across your whole study instead of a ninety day
            blast, and we hand you the conversion data to plan the next one. From protocol to prescreened
            referral, you see every step, and every dollar.
